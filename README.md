What's the highest score you can get in this swarm shooter? After replaying Megaman Battle Network, I could only play a game about destroying viruses.

*Battle routine, set! Execute!*

Shoot: Space

### Controller support:

PS4: Shoot - X
Xbox: Shoot - A
Switch: Shoot - B
Logitech: Shoot - A (tested on F710)

## Why?

I'm learning Godot and thought this would be a neat project after a few basic tutorials. Loving it so far, I deeply encourage any budding game dev to [check it out](https://godotengine.org/) :-)
